## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

### Missing Icons Warning
Icons are optional for development. The app will work fine with placeholder icons. To generate proper icons, see `assets/ICON_GENERATION.md`.

### Port Already in Use
Electron doesn't use ports - this shouldn't happen. If you see this error, another process might be interfering.

### Data Not Saving
Check that the app has write permissions:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/desktop-task-aid/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\desktop-task-aid\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/desktop-task-aid/`

## Next Steps

### Building for Distribution
```bash
# macOS
npm run build:mac

# Windows
npm run build:win

# Linux
npm run build:linux
```

Installers will be created in the `dist/` folder.

### Customization

**Change timer duration:**
Edit `web/script.js`:
```javascript
const DEFAULT_TIMER_SECONDS = 25 * 60; // Change 25 to your preferred minutes
```

**Change theme colors:**
Edit `web/styles.css` in the `:root` section.

**Modify window size:**
Edit `electron/main.js` in the `DEFAULT_WINDOW_STATE` object.

## Data Location

Your tasks and settings are stored at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/desktop-task-aid/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\desktop-task-aid\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/desktop-task-aid/`

To backup your data, copy the `config.json` file from this location.
